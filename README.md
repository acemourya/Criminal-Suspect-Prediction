# Criminal-Suspect-Prediction

## Introduction

-The project aims to predict the criminal suspects for a crime committed as well as to identify where the crime can take place by analyzing criminal records and finding criminal hotspots. 

-Our software is for police officials to lead their investigation effectively and work towards capturing the unrighteous using data analytics thereby uncovering theft and criminal trends which are difficult to recognize through manual inspection techniques. 

-Such software is not only helpful for the police for effective and smart work in case of low-profile crimes but also the increase in arrests for larceny would ultimately lead to low crime rate and a lawful society. 

### WHAT IS PREDICTIVE POLICING?

Predictive policing is the collection and analysis of data about previous crimes for identification and statistical prediction of individuals or geospatial areas with an increased probability of criminal activity to help developing policing intervention and prevention strategies and tactics.

# Result

The software can be customised in the sense of attributes that are most suitable to finding trends of criminal activity in the specific area. 

Generating trends through data mining and prediction techniques in association with huge datasets with information of previous criminals; thus resulting a list of possible suspects for the particular crime with greater accuracy as per the data available

# Conclution

  The software provides a technologically advanced solution to help solve low to mid level criminal investigations in regard to larceny. 

  Prescient policing utilizes information on the occasions, areas and nature of past violations, so as to utilize assets or to have the best possibility of dissuading or forestalling future wrongdoings.Â 

  There is a requirement for a more grounded observational evaluation of these ways to comprehend the connection between highlights of the methodologies and accomplishment in diminishing certain types of wrongdoing. 

  It will be beneficial to examine how these prescient policing models can lessen wrongdoing through counteraction rather than the controlling of geospatial territories and people.
